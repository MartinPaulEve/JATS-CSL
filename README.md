JATS-CSL
========

JATS CSL bibliography style. This CSL style enacts as accurate as possible a transform to the JATS XSML format.

A fork from https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats

## Known limitations
The page range can only display the first page in a range, as CSL does not support breaking down the constituent components of a range. This may be implemented via the page-range element at a later date.

I am also aware that this approach is not ideal. However, in lieu of anything better, I will maintain it as and when I can. See: http://xbiblio-devel.2463403.n2.nabble.com/CSL-Style-to-convert-to-JATS-XML-td7578866.html
